Now we shall see some programming aspects of insertion sort.Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. This algorithm is a simple technique that is easy to understand and implement. The steps done by this algorithm are an iterative solution of how a complex problem can be solved by repeatedly executing very simple steps. To understand how the insertion sort works, imagine that you have a couple of cards in one hand and you need to put them in order of their rank. One way to do it is to make sure cards on the left side in your have been sorted. Then pick up the third card (which is first not sorted) and place it on proper order among the first two cards. At any point in this process, we have two parts, the left part which is sorted and the right part which is not sorted. After each round of insertions, the sorted part grows longer, and the algorithm stops when the last card has been placed where it belongs and the entire hand is sorted.The best case input about the insertion sort algorithm is when the list is already sorted, which has a linear running time (i.e., O(n)). The worst-case input is when the list is sorted in reverse order, this gives us a quadratic running time (i.e., O(n2)). The average case is also quadratic, which puts insertion sort not very useful for sorting large lists. However, insertion sort is one of the fastest algorithms for sorting very small lists. For a given list with n size of items, the best case is when the value is equal to the first element of the list, in which case only one comparison is needed. The worst case is when the value is not in the list or occurs only once at the end of the list, in which case n comparisons are needed.\n"

      "\n",
      "Ans: When you initialize the Deck object, the two for loops of _init_ create Card objects representing all the cards in a 52-card deck and add them to the card list. The first loop goes from 2 to 15 because the first value of a card is 2 and the last value of a card is 14 (the ace). Each time around the inner loop, a new card is created using the integer from the outer loop as the value (i.e. 14 for an ace) and the integer from the inner loop as the suit. This process creates 52 cards – one card for each combination of suit and value. After the method creates the cards, the shuffle method of the shuffle module randomly rearranges the items in the card list; imitating the shuffle of a deck of cards. Our deck has another method called rm_card which removes and returns a card from the card list, or returns None if it is empty.\n",

Our goal is to assign probability to certain events. For example, suppose that we would like to know the probability that the outcome of rolling a fair die is an even number. In this case, our event is the set E={2,4,6}. If the result of our random experiment belongs to the set E, we say that the event E has occurred. Thus an event is a collection of possible outcomes. In other words, an event is a subset of the sample space to which we assign a probability. Although we have not yet discussed how to find the probability of an event, you might be able to guess that the probability of {2,4,6} is 50 percent which is the same as 12 in the probability theory convention.
